The **Accordion** component is used to organize content into expandable and collapsible sections. It is ideal for displaying structured data in a concise and interactive way.

This example demonstrates the use of each sub-component:
- **Accordion.Root**: The root container for the Accordion, which manages the overall state and behavior of the component.
- **Accordion.Item**: Represents an individual section within the Accordion. Each item can be expanded or collapsed independently.
- **Accordion.Trigger**: The clickable element that toggles the visibility of the corresponding content.
- **Accordion.Content**: The content displayed when the associated Accordion.Item is expanded.

You can use this component to improve content accessibility and maintain a clean UI design.
